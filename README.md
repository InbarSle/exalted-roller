# exalted-roller
Dice roller for the Exalted RPG system by Onyx Path Publishing.

Node app, rolling logic written in javascript, uses Discord.js to connect to chat.

I'm proud of the recursive rerolling feature. Writing it taught me a whole bunch. I also learned to use Objects and they're pretty magical.

## To-do:
* Better error handling
* More helpful help (really any help feature at all)
* Option to not double 10's
* Option to have /db7+ mean double 7, 8, 9, and 10
